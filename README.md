<h1>Area Minimization algorithms</h1>
This repository contains an algorithms for area minimization that use three canonical expansions - Shannon expansion, positive and negative Davio expansions.
The benchmarks from IWLS'22 (https://github.com/alanminko/iwls2022-ls-contest) are used for testing.

Run algorithm that uses Shannon expansion and fixed variable order: ```./recsyn -v "input function truth table"```

```c
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```
