# Area Minimization algorithms
This repository contains an algorithms for area minimization that use three canonical expansions - Shannon expansion, positive and negative Davio expansions.
The <a href="https://github.com/alanminko/iwls2022-ls-contest">benchmarks</a> from IWLS'22 Programming Contest are used for testing.
## Compiling
To compile algorithms download or copy code from `recsyn` folder.


Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.
Run algorithm that uses Shannon expansion and fixed variable order: ```./recsyn -v 80```

```c
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```
