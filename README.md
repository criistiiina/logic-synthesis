# Area Minimization algorithms
This repository contains an algorithms for area minimization that use three canonical expansions - Shannon expansion, positive and negative Davio expansions.
The <a href="https://github.com/alanminko/iwls2022-ls-contest">benchmarks</a> from IWLS'22 Programming Contest are used for testing.
## Compiling
To compile algorithms download or copy code from `src/recsyn` folder. <br>
Examples how to run different algorithms for one function or list of functions.
Run algorithm that uses Shannon expansion and fixed variable order: `./recsyn -v 80`.
